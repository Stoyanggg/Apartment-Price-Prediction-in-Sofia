# Apartment Price Prediction in Sofia

This project aims to predict apartment prices in Sofia by scraping data from the website Imot.bg. The gathered data includes various attributes of selling apartments in Sofia, such as location, parameters, and price. The project involves data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and the development of machine learning models for price prediction.

## Data Collection

Data was scraped from Imot.bg using Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup. The scraped data was then stored in a SQLite database for further processing.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation

The collected data underwent extensive cleaning and manipulation to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and prepare it for analysis. Data preprocessing techniques were applied to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset.

## Visualization

Visualization techniques were employed to explore the relationships between different features and apartment prices. Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized to create insightful visualizations that provide a deeper understanding of the data.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were developed to predict apartment prices based on various features. Models such as Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor were implemented using scikit-learn.
